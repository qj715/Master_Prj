# Master_Prj

Two folder are provided in this project.
1. The FYP is based on a MEng. Student who designed the board. The code here is more complex, including both loop and applying FreeRTOS.
2. The Project is the core of the execution loop in this specific task. Some errors are corrected based on the previous version. 

The way to install the project can be found in the report in both folders.
